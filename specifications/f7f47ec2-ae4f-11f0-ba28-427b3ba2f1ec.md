- **Module 2: Smart Contract Development for EdTech (8 ECTS):** Provides in-depth, hands-on training in Solidity and secure smart contract development, with exercises focused on credentialing logic.
- **Module 3: Decentralized Application (DApp) Design (8 ECTS):** Focuses on building user-facing applications that interact with smart contracts using modern web3 libraries and front-end frameworks.
- **Module 4: Governance, Ethics, and Pedagogy in Decentralized Systems (2 ECTS):** A critical module on the non-technical implications of blockchain, including data privacy, decentralized governance (DAOs), and pedagogical impact.
- **Module 5: Capstone Project: Building a Verifiable Credential DApp (6 ECTS):** A summative project where learners synthesize all their skills to build and defend a complete verifiable credential system.

### **11. Mode of Instruction**
- **Mode:** Blended Learning, combining asynchronous online modules with synchronous workshops, studio sessions, and project supervision.

### **12. Learning Outcomes**
Upon successful completion of this microcredential, the learner will be able to:
- **LO1:** Critically evaluate the potential of blockchain technology to address systemic issues in education.

- **LO3:** Develop, test, and deploy secure and efficient smart contracts on a public blockchain for educational applications.
- **LO4:** Construct a functional Decentralized Application (DApp) that provides a user-facing service for the education domain.
- **LO5:** Analyze the ethical, social, and pedagogical implications of implementing decentralized identity systems in learning environments.
- **LO6:** Manage a complex, self-directed project from conception to deployment, demonstrating advanced technical and project management skills.

### **13. Level of Experience**
- **EQF Level:** 7 (Advanced)
