*   **Module 3: Industry Standards and Advanced Project Management:** Applies design skills within a professional context, covering BIM integration, advanced contract documentation, client management, and the finalization of the capstone project.

### **11. Mode of Instruction**
*   **Mode:** Hybrid, Asynchronous. The course combines on-demand video lectures and software demonstrations with project-based learning. It includes optional live weekly Q&A sessions, peer-to-peer collaboration forums, and one-on-one mentoring for the capstone project.

### **12. Learning Outcomes**
The recipient has demonstrated the ability to:
*   **Synthesize** sustainability principles and advanced digital tools to create high-performance interior environments.
*   **Validate** design decisions using data-driven analysis and real-time simulation.
