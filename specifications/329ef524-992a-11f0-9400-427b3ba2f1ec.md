### **9. Learning Objectives**
Upon successful completion of this microcredential, learners will be able to:
1.  Synthesize advanced design theories (e.g., biophilic design, WELL Building Standard, circular economy principles) to create innovative and human-centric interior environments.
2.  Master complex digital workflows, integrating BIM (Revit), advanced 3D visualization, and post-production techniques to produce photorealistic and immersive project presentations.
3.  Lead a comprehensive design project from client briefing to final documentation within a studio-based environment, demonstrating advanced problem-solving and creative direction.
4.  Manage the business aspects of an interior design project, including budget development, project scheduling, contract administration, and stakeholder communication, applying industry-standard project management principles.
5.  Critically Evaluate design solutions through evidence-based research and articulate design intent with clarity and professionalism to clients, critics, and collaborators.

### **10. Content Description**
The curriculum is structured across five integrated modules that guide the learner from advanced theory to professional practice and portfolio development.
*   **Module 1: Advanced Design Theory & Research (4 ECTS):** Explores sustainable design, circular economy principles, wellness standards (WELL, Fitwel), and evidence-based design methods.
*   **Module 2: Advanced Digital Workflows & Visualization (6 ECTS):** Provides hands-on mastery of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with Revit, photorealistic rendering with V-Ray, and immersive VR/AR presentations.
*   **Module 3: The Integrated Design Studio (8 ECTS):** A core project-based module focused on developing a complex, multi-use commercial or hospitality project from concept to specification.
*   **Module 4: Professional Practice & Project Management (6 ECTS):** Covers the business of design, including project management, contract documentation, budgeting, scheduling, and client relations.
*   **Module 5: Capstone Project & Portfolio (6 ECTS):** A self-directed capstone project where learners synthesize all acquired skills to produce a comprehensive, portfolio-ready design project.

### **11. Mode of Instruction**
*   **Blended Learning:** The program combines the flexibility of asynchronous learning with the collaborative, feedback-rich environment of synchronous sessions.
    *   **Asynchronous (60%):** Pre-recorded lectures, software tutorials, readings, and discussion forums that allow learners to work at their own pace.
    *   **Synchronous (40%):** Weekly live virtual studio sessions, guest lectures from industry professionals, and one-on-one critique sessions to foster community and provide personalized feedback.
