**Recommendation for ESCO Mapping:**
When formally mapping these skills to ESCO for the micro-credential, it is recommended to use the provided URIs where available. For concepts where direct skill URIs were not found (AI, ML, IoT, Edge Computing), the learning objectives and content descriptions of the micro-credential should clearly articulate the relevance to the broader ESCO framework, referencing the process-oriented mentions of these technologies within ESCO's documentation. Furthermore, when referring to skills like "Drone Technology" or "Communication Protocols", the closest aligned ESCO skills/knowledge (e.g., "Guidance, navigation and control" for drones, "Computer networks" for protocols) should be used, with a clear indication of their relation.

This mapping strengthens the micro-credential's alignment with European standards and enhances its recognition within the educational and employment landscape.

For concepts where direct skill URIs were not found (AI, ML, IoT, Edge Computing), the learning objectives and content descriptions of the micro-credential should clearly articulate the relevance to the broader ESCO framework, referencing the process-oriented mentions of these technologies within ESCO's documentation. Furthermore, when referring to skills like \"Drone Technology\" or \"Communication Protocols\", the closest aligned ESCO skills/knowledge (e.g., \"Guidance, navigation and control\" for drones, \"Computer networks\" for protocols) should be used, with a clear indication of their relation.\n\nThis mapping strengthens the micro-credential's alignment with European standards and enhances its recognition within the educational and employment landscape."}
