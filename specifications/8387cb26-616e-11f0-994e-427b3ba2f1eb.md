## 5. Content Description and Pedagogical Approach

This micro-credential employs a blended **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** and **Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL)** approach. The curriculum is structured around a central project where learners design and simulate a comprehensive IoT solution for a selected agronomic problem, incorporating edge intelligence and data privacy.

### **Module 1: Foundations of IoT in Agronomy (Inquiry-Based)**
*   **Topics Covered:** Smart Farming Economics, IoT System Architectures (Cloud vs. Edge), Data Governance.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Sub-module 1.1: The Smart Farming Revolution:** Through guided inquiry with case studies of failing vs. successful smart farms, learners will investigate the critical factors (technological, economic, environmental) for success.
    *   **Sub-module 1.2: Architecting Agri-IoT Systems:** Learners will review industry white papers and academic articles to diagram and compare different models (e.g., cloud-centric vs. edge-heavy) for various agronomic scenarios.
    *   **Sub-module 1.3: Data Ethics and GDPR Compliance in Smart Farming:** Learners will analyze GDPR articles relevant to IoT (Art. 5, 25, 32) and discuss the classification of farm data (personal vs. anonymized). They will produce a short Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for their proposed capstone project.

### **Module 2: The Sensing Layer: Data and Connectivity from the Field (Project-Based)**
*   **Topics Covered:** Sensor Physics and Calibration, Embedded C++, LPWAN Protocols (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT), Power Budgeting.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Sub-module 2.1: Sensor Selection and Integration:** Based on their project, learners will research and select appropriate sensors. They will use a simulation environment to write and debug simple C++ code to read and calibrate sensor data.
    *   **Sub-module 2.2: LPWAN Connectivity and Power Management:** In a project-based lab, learners will choose between LoRaWAN and NB-IoT based on project constraints (range, data rate, cost) and must calculate a detailed power budget for a remote sensor node to ensure multi-year battery life.

### **Module 3: Data Processing: From Cloud Pipelines to Edge Intelligence (Project-Based)**
*   **Topics Covered:** MQTT Protocol, Cloud IoT Platforms (AWS/Azure), Geospatial Data Analysis (GeoPandas), Machine Learning, Edge AI (TensorFlow Lite).
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Sub-module 3.1: Cloud Data Ingestion and Geospatial Analysis:** Learners will set up an AWS IoT Core platform using MQTT to create a data ingestion pipeline. They will then use Python's GeoPandas library to overlay simulated sensor data onto a farm map, generating location-aware visualizations.
    *   **Sub-module 3.2: Predictive Analytics and Edge AI for Agronomy:** Learners will train a machine learning model (e.g., for pest detection). The core task is to convert and optimize this model using TensorFlow Lite for deployment on a simulated edge device, enabling on-site, low-latency inference.

### **Module 4: Capstone Project and Future Frontiers (Project & Inquiry-Based)**
*   **Topics Covered:** Agile Project Management, DevOps (Docker, Terraform), Research Methods.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Sub-module 4.1: End-to-End Project Implementation & Deployment:** Learners finalize their project, integrating all components. They will structure their project report using Agile principles (defining sprints and a feature backlog) and prepare a video demonstration that serves as a mock "sprint review". An optional advanced workshop introduces packaging the solution with Docker and defining cloud infrastructure using Terraform (IaC).
    *   **Sub-module 4.2: Future Trends & Research Inquiry:** Based on a prompt, learners will research an emerging topic (e.g., blockchain for supply chains, Digital Twins for Agriculture) and write a short research proposal outlining a potential investigation.
