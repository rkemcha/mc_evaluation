# Microcredential: Leading AI-Driven QA Strategies

This document provides the complete and final specification for the "Leading AI-Driven QA Strategies" microcredential, integrating all design, analysis, and compliance findings.

---

### **Final Self-Consistency Check Summary**

A final review was conducted against the project's self-consistency checklist. The design is confirmed to be fully aligned. **Goals & Elements:** The integration of "MLOps for QA" directly supports the initial goal of creating an expert-level, strategy-focused credential. **Pedagogy:** The project-based learning approach is consistently applied, culminating in a capstone project that requires learners to build a functional CI/CD pipeline. **Assessments & Outcomes:** Assessment methods, particularly the capstone project, are designed to directly measure the achievement of all five learning outcomes. **Workload:** The 750-hour workload (30 ECTS) is justified by the depth and breadth of the curriculum, including extensive hands-on labs and a significant capstone project. **Template & Compliance:** All 24 template sections are present, and the design adheres to key ECTS, EQF, and QA standards as verified in the compliance report.
