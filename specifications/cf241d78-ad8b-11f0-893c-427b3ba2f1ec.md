### **10. Content Description**
The curriculum is structured around a capstone project and delivered across three integrated modules:
*   **Module 1: Strategic Foresight & AI Innovation Frameworks (30 hours):** Covers horizon scanning for emerging AI in education (e.g., adaptive learning, generative AI), applying innovation models, conducting needs analysis, and establishing ethical AI governance principles through case studies of AI implementations.
*   **Module 2: Leading AI-Driven Change & Implementation Science (30 hours):** Focuses on applying change management theories (e.g., Kotter's 8-Step Model) to AI adoption, stakeholder mapping for AI projects, resource allocation, and developing communication plans. Learners create a Change Management Blueprint for their capstone project.
*   **Module 3: The AI Innovation Lab & Capstone Project (50 hours):** A project-based module where learners, in small groups, develop a proposal and low-fidelity prototype for an AI-driven EdTech innovation. Includes workshops on prompt engineering for pedagogical design and selecting appropriate AI tools.

### **11. Mode of Instruction**
