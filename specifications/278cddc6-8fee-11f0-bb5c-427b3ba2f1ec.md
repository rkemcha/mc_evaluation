**Long-term Considerations:**
1. **Investigate and address national education standards and accreditation prerequisites** - Program Manager - Benefits: Increased recognition and credibility.

## 5. COMPLIANCE REASONING TRAIL:
- **EQF Level Assignment**: The learning outcomes align with EQF Level 7 descriptors (Master's Level), indicating that the micro-credential requires specialized knowledge, analytical skills, and the ability to manage complex projects.
- **ECTS Credit Allocation:** The initial ECTS credit allocation (6 ECTS) seemed appropriate for the given workload (180 hours). However, a deeper analysis reveals that the allocation needs reassessment to accurately reflect the effort required.
- **GDPR Compliance:** Due to the sensitive nature of student data, GDPR compliance is crucial. A comprehensive data protection policy is necessary to ensure that student data is handled responsibly and ethically.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines is essential for ensuring that the micro-credential is accessible to students with disabilities.
