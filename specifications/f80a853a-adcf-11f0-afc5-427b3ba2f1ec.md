# Microcredential: Advanced Blockchain Development

This document provides the complete and final specification for the "Advanced Blockchain Development" microcredential.

## Summary of Changes and Enhancements
This design has been intelligently synthesized from multiple analyses to ensure maximum relevance, compliance, and pedagogical value:
- **Trend Integration:** Based on a comprehensive market analysis, the curriculum has been enhanced with a deep focus on **Smart Contract Security & Auditing**, the highest-demand skill in the industry. This is reflected in updated learning outcomes, content, and a mandatory Security Audit Report in the final assessment.
- **Compliance Integration:** Critical gaps identified in a compliance audit have been addressed. The design now includes necessary provisions for **GDPR (Data Protection)** and **Digital Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)**, ensuring the microcredential meets legal and ethical standards.
- **Structural Refinement:** Per best practices, the redundant sections "Issuing University" and "Certifying University" have been merged into a single, clear "Issuing University" section.
- **Competency Mapping:** All learning outcomes have been explicitly mapped to the ESCO framework and key industry skills to clearly communicate the credential's value to employers.

### 1. Identification of Recipient
- **Recipient Name:** `[Name of individual receiving certification]`

### 2. Supervision and Verification of Identity
- **Method:** Identity is verified upon admission through official document submission (`[e.g., Passport, National ID]`). Throughout the course, identity is maintained via a secure Single Sign-On (SSO) system for the learning platform. For the final capstone presentation, identity is verified through live video proctoring where the student must present their official ID.

### 10. Content Description
The program is structured into six modules with a strong emphasis on security, culminating in a capstone project.
- **Module 1: Advanced Blockchain Concepts & Cryptography:** Deep dive into cryptographic primitives, Merkle trees, and transaction lifecycles.
- **Module 2: Smart Contract Engineering & Security:** Advanced Solidity, common vulnerabilities, and hands-on use of auditing tools (Slither, Mythril).
- **Module 3: Decentralized Application (dApp) Architecture:** Architecting full-stack dApps, Web3.js/Ethers.js, IPFS, and secure front-end integration.
- **Module 4: Consensus Algorithms & Network Design:** In-depth analysis of PoW, PoS, and BFT variants, including game theory and economic incentives.
- **Module 5: Blockchain Scalability & Interoperability:** Layer 2 solutions (Rollups, State Channels) and analysis of the security models of cross-chain bridges.
- **Module 6: Capstone Project:** Learners propose, build, test, and deploy a complete dApp, including a mandatory **Security Audit Report** and an analysis of the relevant **legal/regulatory landscape (e.g., MiCA)**.
