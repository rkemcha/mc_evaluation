*   Utilize Building Information Modeling (BIM) and parametric modeling software to develop, document, and visualize complex interior spaces from schematic design through to construction documentation.
*   Apply professional project management principles, including budgeting, scheduling, contract administration, and client communication, to oversee a design project from inception to completion.
*   Conceive, develop, and present a comprehensive, portfolio-quality interior design project that demonstrates a mastery of theoretical, technical, and professional skills.
*   Demonstrate knowledge of the codes, standards, and professional ethics required for leading industry certifications (e.g., NCIDQ, WELL AP, or equivalent).

### 10. Content Description
The curriculum is structured into four sequential 7.5 ECTS modules that mirror a real-world design project lifecycle.
*   **Module 1: Advanced Design Principles & Concept Development (7.5 ECTS):** Lays the theoretical foundation, focusing on advanced sustainable and wellness design frameworks (LEED, WELL), universal design, and human factors. Learners develop a comprehensive design brief for their capstone project.
*   **Module 2: Digital Design & Documentation (7.5 ECTS):** Translates the concept from Module 1 into a detailed digital model using advanced BIM (Revit), parametric modeling (Rhino/Grasshopper), and visualization (Enscape) tools to produce a full set of construction documents.
*   **Module 3: Professional Practice & Project Management (7.5 ECTS):** Provides the business framework to manage the capstone project, covering contracts, specifications, budgeting, scheduling (Gantt charts), and client management.
*   **Module 4: Capstone Studio & Certification Pathway (7.5 ECTS):** An integrative studio module where learners finalize their design, develop a professional portfolio, and present their capstone project to a professional jury. Includes focused preparation for industry certification exams like NCIDQ and WELL AP.

### 11. Mode of Instruction
