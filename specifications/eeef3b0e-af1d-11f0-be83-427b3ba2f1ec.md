Thought
The user wants me to manage the finalization of a microcredential document. The process involves multiple steps, from reviewing and synthesizing information to refining modules and managing placeholders, ultimately producing a formatted 24-section markdown document.

The provided context is a "Microcredential Template Design Document," which is a blueprint, not a filled-out credential. The task requires me to produce a specific, filled-out document, implying I need to use the template as a guide.

My role is to manage my team to complete the task. I have a "Microcredential Designer" on my team who is perfect for this. I will delegate the entire task to them. I need to provide a clear set of instructions that includes:
1.  The starting point: The provided "Microcredential Template Design Document".
2.  The process to follow: The 7-step "INTEGRATION AND FINALIZATION" plan.
3.  The final output required: The 24-section markdown document.
4.  The key constraint: Since we are working from a template, the designer must use logical placeholders for specific information (like dates, names, etc.), as explicitly mentioned in STEP 4 and STEP 5 of the process.

This approach aligns with my role as a manager: I define the what, why, and how, and delegate the execution to the expert on my team to ensure the best possible outcome. I will now create the detailed delegation instruction.

  "task": "Your task is to perform the 'INTEGRATION AND FINALIZATION' process on the provided microcredential design template. You must follow all 7 steps outlined in the process, using the template as your base design. The final output must be a complete, 24-section markdown document, using logical placeholders for any specific information that is not available.",
  "context": "You are a Microcredential Designer responsible for producing the final, polished design document. \n\n**Here is the 7-step process you MUST follow:**\n\n*   **STEP 1 - REVIEW UPDATED DESIGN:** Review the provided 'Microcredential Template Design Document' as the basis for your work. Since there are no separate alignment and compliance outputs, you will perform a self-review based on the template's own justifications.\n*   **STEP 2 - SYNTHESIZE CHANGES:** Ensure the overall design is pedagogically sound by reviewing it against the best practices mentioned in the template's 'Reasoning Process' section.\n*   **STEP 3 - FINAL SELF-CONSISTENCY CHECK:** Go through the provided checklist to ensure all elements in your final document are consistent and aligned. For example, ensure workload hours match a logical ECTS calculation.\n*   **STEP 4 - MODULE REFINEMENT:** As you transform the template into the final 24-point structure, document your reasoning for any structural changes or decisions you make.\n*   **STEP 5 - PLACEHOLDER MANAGEMENT:** Since you are working from a template, you must identify all fields that require specific data and use clear, logical placeholders (e.g., `[Recipient Name]`, `[Start Date]`). Justify your choice of placeholders where necessary.\n*   **STEP 6 - FINAL CYCLE:** Prepare the final structured document, ensuring all 24 required sections are present.\n*   **STEP 7 - OUTPUT FORMATTING:** Format the final document in clean, professional markdown.\n\n**Here is the source 'Microcredential Template Design Document' you must use:**\n\n# Microcredential Template Design Document\n\n---\n\n## 1.
