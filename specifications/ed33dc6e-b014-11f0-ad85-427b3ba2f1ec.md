*   **Module 3: Advanced Design Studio:** A series of hands-on, project-based learning experiences where students tackle complex commercial and residential design challenges, integrating sustainability and human-centered design principles.
*   **Module 4: Professional Practice and Management:** Focuses on project management, budgeting, scheduling, contract law, ethics, and client communication.

*Accessibility Commitment:* The online learning platform and all digital materials provided comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards.

### **11. Mode of Instruction**
*   **Hybrid:** A blend of online asynchronous learning for theoretical content (lectures, readings) and required weekly on-campus attendance for intensive, hands-on studio work, faculty critiques, and workshops.

### **12. Learning Outcomes**
Upon successful completion of this microcredential, the learner will be able to:
1.  **Analyze** and solve complex spatial design problems by applying principles of circular economy, life-cycle assessment, and sustainable material specification to meet diverse client needs, integrating concepts of accessibility and human-centered design.
2.  **Develop** and manage a comprehensive interior design project from concept to completion, including budgeting, scheduling, and client communication.
3.  **Create** professional-grade design presentations and technical documentation using industry-standard digital tools (e.g., Revit, Enscape).
4.  **Critique** and reflect upon design work, articulating design decisions with theoretical and practical justifications.
