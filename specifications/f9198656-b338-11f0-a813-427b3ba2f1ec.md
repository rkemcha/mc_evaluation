Thought: I have just completed the Compliance Verification Report, which identified several areas needing updates in the microcredential design. My current task is "STEP 1 - UPDATE DESIGN with alignment and compliance outputs if they exist".

I will now go through the recommendations from the Compliance Report and integrate them into the 24 sections of the microcredential design.

**Summary of Recommendations and how they will be incorporated:**

1.  **Quality Assurance Compliance (Section 4):**
    *   Formalize Student Feedback, Establish Continuous Improvement, Define External Review.
    *   *Action:* Expand section **22. Quality Assurance** to explicitly detail these processes.

2.  **Accessibility Compliance (Section 5):**
    *   WCAG Compliance, Alternative Formats, Assessment Accommodations, Platform Accessibility.
    *   *Action:* Integrate these points into **22. Quality Assurance** as a dedicated sub-point, and implicitly ensure they are considered in **11. Mode of Instruction** and **18. Assessment Methods**.

3.  **Data Protection Compliance (Section 6 - GDPR):**
    *   Purpose Limitation, Data Minimization, Retention Period, Security Measures, Student Rights.
    *   *Action:* Integrate these points into **22. Quality Assurance** as a dedicated sub-point, making the microcredential's GDPR stance explicit.

4.  **Industry-Specific Regulations (Section 7 - Robotics Safety):**
    *   Explicit Safety Standard Integration, Regulatory Awareness.
    *   *Action:*
        *   Update **10. Content Description (Module 3)** to explicitly mention EN ISO 10218 series for lab safety.
        *   Refine **11. Learning Outcomes (LO5)** to ensure "critically assess emerging research trends" includes regulatory considerations.
        *   Add a point to **15. Learning Activities** regarding safety protocol training.

I will now generate the complete updated microcredential design document, reflecting these changes.
