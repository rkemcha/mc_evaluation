- Familiarity with containerization concepts (e.g., Docker) is recommended.

### 9. Learning Objectives
- To equip experienced developers with the advanced skills required to build, secure, observe, and deploy high-performance, resilient, and scalable cloud-native applications using the Quarkus framework.
- To provide mastery of modern architectural patterns, including event-driven communication with Kafka and deployment strategies for Kubernetes.
- To prepare learners for senior software engineering and architect roles in a cloud-native landscape through rigorous, project-based learning.

### 10. Content Description
This microcredential consists of five modules that guide the learner from advanced framework features to full application deployment in a cloud-native environment.

-   **Module 1: Quarkus Core & Advanced Reactive Patterns:** Covers advanced CDI, reactive programming with Mutiny, and building non-blocking REST APIs.
-   **Module 2: Building Resilient and Deployable Microservices:** Focuses on MicroProfile Fault Tolerance patterns (Circuit Breakers, Retries) and linking health checks to Kubernetes probes.
-   **Module 3: Event-Driven Communication with Kafka:** Introduces Event-Driven Architecture, Kafka fundamentals, and implementation of producers/consumers using Quarkus Reactive Messaging.
-   **Module 4: Securing and Observing Cloud-Native Systems:** Details securing endpoints with JWT/OIDC and implementing comprehensive observability (metrics, logging, tracing) using the OpenTelemetry standard.
-   **Module 5: Final Project: Cloud-Native Application Deployment:** A capstone project where learners build and deploy a multi-service application that is resilient, secure, observable, communicates via Kafka, and is deployed to Kubernetes.

### 11. Mode of Instruction
- **Online:** A combination of synchronous or pre-recorded lectures, guided hands-on labs, and asynchronous self-directed learning and project work.

### 12. Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion, learners will be able to:
- Design and implement resilient microservices using advanced Quarkus and MicroProfile features.
- Integrate asynchronous, event-driven communication patterns using Kafka.
- Secure microservices using modern authentication and authorization protocols.
- Implement comprehensive observability using the OpenTelemetry standard for metrics, logging, and distributed tracing.
- Package, configure, and deploy a containerized microservices application to Kubernetes.
