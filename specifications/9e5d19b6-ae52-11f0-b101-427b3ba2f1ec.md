## 9. Learning Objectives
**Objectives:** Upon successful completion of this microcredential, learners will be able to:
1.  Architect scalable and maintainable React applications by critically evaluating and implementing advanced design patterns (e.g., Compound Components, State Reducer).
2.  Master state management strategies for complex applications, distinguishing between client and server state and implementing robust solutions using Context API, custom hooks, and libraries like React Query.
3.  Optimize the performance of React applications through advanced techniques including code-splitting, memoization, and component profiling.
4.  Enhance application quality and developer workflow by establishing comprehensive testing strategies and integrating with modern CI/CD pipelines.
5.  Design and build a production-grade, full-stack React application that demonstrates mastery of advanced patterns, performance optimization, and maintainability.

## 10. Content Description
**Modules:** The curriculum is structured into four core modules followed by a capstone project.
*   **Module 1: Advanced Architectural Patterns (3 Weeks):** Focuses on the principles of scalable software design. Learners will analyze and implement reusable component patterns like Compound Components, Render Props, and custom hooks to build a flexible and maintainable application foundation.
*   **Module 2: Mastering State Management (4 Weeks):** A deep dive into application state. Learners will differentiate between client and server state, architect global state solutions with Context API, and use server state libraries like React Query to manage caching, synchronization, and optimistic updates.
*   **Module 3: High-Performance React (3 Weeks):** Covers techniques for diagnosing and fixing performance bottlenecks. Learners will use the React DevTools Profiler, implement code-splitting with `React.lazy`, and apply memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to optimize rendering.
*   **Module 4: Professional-Grade Testing & Quality (2 Weeks):** Focuses on ensuring application robustness. Learners will write comprehensive unit and integration tests with React Testing Library, mock API requests using Mock Service Worker (MSW), and integrate their test suite into a CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Capstone Project & Defense (3 Weeks):** A culminating project where learners synthesize all learned concepts to design, build, and deploy a full-stack, production-grade React application, defending their architectural decisions in an oral presentation.

## 11. Mode of Instruction
**Mode:** Blended Learning. This microcredential combines asynchronous pre-recorded lectures and readings with synchronous, instructor-led live coding workshops and project-based studio sessions.

## 12. Learning Outcomes
**Achieved Competencies:** Upon completion, learners will have demonstrated the ability to:
*   Design and implement scalable software architectures in a front-end context.
*   Apply advanced software design patterns to solve complex component-level problems.
*   Manage both client-side and server-side state effectively in a modern React application.
*   Profile, diagnose, and optimize the performance of web applications.
*   Establish and execute a professional-grade testing strategy for a component-based system.
*   Integrate quality assurance practices into an automated CI/CD workflow.
